### Features
* Add your bookmarks front & center.
* Github commit box lights up if you've commited something to Github today.
* Shows you today's weather, automatically localized.
* Simple and lightweight To-do list on the right.

### Cuztomization
Only requires specification of your preferred name & Github username. Username is used for [Github search API](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-commits) and name is only used for the greeting message.

All data is saved in your browser's localStore. This means your name & username, as well as any bookmarks and to-do items are never sent anywhere. There is no backend or database.

### Editing
Want to modify this project?

Everything is written in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). To make edits, fork & clone, then do the usual `npm install` & `npm run serve`

### WTF is a startpage?
Tired of the boring default new-tab page in Chrome? Create your own web page with whatever you want on it! (this is mine, for example) Or use a pre-existing one (there's a [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages/) full of them.) Then link your new-tab default page to it.
